0. Introduction
0.1 Purpose of this Document
This syllabus forms the basis for the qualification of Mobile Application Testing at the Foundation 
Level. The ISTQB® provides this syllabus as follows:
1. To National Boards, to translate into their local language and to accredit training providers. 
National Boards may adapt the syllabus to their particular language needs and modify the 
references to adapt to their local publications.
2. To Exam Boards, to derive examination questions in their local language adapted to the 
learning objectives for each syllabus.
3. To training providers, to produce courseware and determine appropriate teaching methods.
4. To certification candidates, to prepare for the exam (as part of a training course or 
independently).
5. To the international software and systems engineering community, to advance the profession 
of software and systems testing, and as a basis for books and articles.
The ISTQB® may allow other entities to use this syllabus for other purposes, provided they seek and 
obtain prior written permission.
0.2 The Certified Foundation Level Mobile Application Testing
The Foundation Level qualification is aimed at anyone involved in software testing who wishes to 
broaden their knowledge of Mobile Application Testing or anyone who wishes to start a specialist 
career in Mobile Application Testing. 
Information about Mobile Application Testing described in the ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation 
Level syllabus [ISTQB_CTFL_2018] has been considered in creating this syllabus. 
0.3 Business Outcomes
This section lists the business outcomes expected of a candidate who has achieved the Foundation 
Level Mobile Application Testing certification.
MAT-01 Understand and review business and technology drivers for mobile apps in order to create 
a test strategy.
MAT-02 Identify and understand the key challenges, risks and expectations associated with testing 
a mobile application.
MAT-03 Apply test types and levels specific to mobile applications.
MAT-04 Apply common test types, such as those mentioned in [ISTQB_CTFL_2018], in the mobile 
specific context.
MAT-05 Carry out the activities required specifically for mobile application testing as part of the 
main activities described in the ISTQB® test process.
MAT-06 Identify and use suitable environments and appropriate tools for mobile application testing.
MAT-07 Understand methods and tools used specifically to support mobile application test 
automation.

0.4 Examinable Learning Objectives
These learning objectives support the business outcomes and are used to create the examination 
which must be passed to achieve the Foundation Level Mobile Application Testing Certification. 
Learning objectives are allocated to a cognitive level of knowledge (K-Level).
A K-level, or cognitive level, is used to classify learning objectives according to the revised taxonomy 
from Bloom [Anderson 2001]. ISTQB® uses this taxonomy to design examinations against its syllabi.
This syllabus considers three different K-levels (K1 to K3). For more information see chapter 7.
0.5 Hands-on Levels of Competency
Mobile Application Testing Foundation Level introduces the concept of Hands-On Objectives which
focus on practical skills and competencies. 
Competencies can be achieved by performing hands-on exercises, such as those shown in the 
following non-exhaustive list:
● Exercises for K3 level learning objectives performed using paper and pen or word processing 
software, as is done for various existing ISTQB® syllabi.
● Setting up and using test environments.
● Testing applications on virtual and physical devices.
● Using tools on desktops and/or mobile devices to test or assist in testing related tasks such as 
installation, querying, logging, monitoring, taking screenshots etc.
The following levels apply to hands-on objectives:
● H0: This can include a live demo of an exercise or recorded video. Since this is not performed 
by the trainee, it is not strictly an exercise.
● H1: Guided exercise. The trainees follow a sequence of steps performed by the trainer.
● H2: Exercise with hints. The trainee is given an exercise with relevant hints to enable the 
exercise to be solved within the given timeframe.
● H3: Unguided exercises without hints.
Recommendations:
● K1 learning objectives typically use H0 level and H1 or H2 when the situation demands.
● K2 learning objectives typically use H1 or H2 levels and H0 or H3 when the situation 
demands.
K3 learning objectives typically use H2 or H3 levels, although it is not always necessary to have a 
hands-on exercise for a K3 learning objective. If the setup is complex or if it will be too time 
consuming, then use H0 level.
0.6 The Examination
The Mobile Application Testing Foundation Level Certificate exam will be based on this syllabus. 
Answers to exam questions may require knowledge based on more than one section of this syllabus. 
All sections of the syllabus are examinable, except for the introduction and appendices. Standards, 
books, and other ISTQB® syllabi are included as references, but their content is not examinable, 
beyond what is summarized in this syllabus itself.
The Mobile Application Testing Foundation Level exam is multiple choice. There are 40 questions. To 
pass the exam, at least 65% of the questions (i.e., 26 questions) must be answered correctly. Handson objectives and exercises will not be examined.

center or in a public exam). Completion of an accredited training course is not a prerequisite for the 
exam.
Somebody who wants to appear for the exam without getting trained from an accredited training 
provider should read the competence guidelines as provided in the Accreditation and Competence 
Guidelines document [CTFL-MAT-2019-Accreditation-and-Competence-Guidelines.pdf] and try to 
conduct these hands-on exercises themselves. This will help them gain the competencies that an 
accredited training provider would be expected to impart. Please note that this has no bearing on the 
Mobile Application Testing Foundation Level certification examination as the exam is only based on 
this syllabus and its learning objectives.
0.7 Recommended Training Times
A minimum training time has been defined for each learning objective in this syllabus. The total time 
for each chapter is indicated in the chapter heading.
Training providers should note that other ISTQB® syllabi apply a “standard time” approach which 
allocates fixed times according to the K-Level. The Mobile Application Testing syllabus does not 
strictly apply this scheme. As a result, training providers are given a more flexible and realistic 
indication of minimum training times for each learning objective.
0.8 Entry Requirements
The ISTQB® Foundation Level certificate must be obtained before taking this exam.
0.9 Sources of Information
Terms used in the syllabus are defined in the ISTQB®’s Glossary of Terms used in Software Testing 
[ISTQB_GLOSSARY]. 
Chapter 6 contains a list of recommended books and articles on Mobile Application Testing.

1.1 Mobile Analytics Data
There are many stakeholders in the mobile world including manufacturers, platform providers, 
operating system (OS) providers, market data providers, tool providers and, of course, application 
developers and testers.
In order to contribute effectively to test planning discussions and test analysis, a mobile application 
tester should be aware of and familiar with the following factors:
● The business implications of the distribution of platforms
Certified Tester Specialist
Mobile Application Testing Foundation Level
Syllabus
Version 2019 Page 12 of 51
3 May 2019
© International Software Testing Qualifications Board
● Application downloads per platform
● The quantity and distribution of OS versions
● The market distribution of various device types, including variations based on geographical 
location
● Differing screen sizes and resolutions
● The various input methods
● Camera types
There are several sources of information for the above, both free and commercial-based. These 
include StatCounter GlobalStats [URL1], the OS vendors themselves and other third-party sources.
The mobile analytics data is used to select a device portfolio for test execution that is appropriate for 
the target market. Tests are run over this portfolio to test the app on a device in accordance with the 
importance of the device. The data related to devices and their special features, if any, may also be
used to design tests specific to a device type. For example, a device with heart beat sensor may need 
special test cases.
1.2 Business Models for Mobile Apps
There are several models which can be used to monetize the work done in creating mobile 
applications. These include but are not limited to: Freemium, advertisement-based, transaction-based, 
fee-based, and enterprise applications. In addition, in-app purchases can be applied to some of these
models.
There are certain advantages and disadvantages for each of these approaches and the tester should 
keep the business model in mind whilst testing the mobile application.
In a Freemium model the applications are generally free but users have to pay if the need additional
features. The applications need to provide sufficient features to be attractive to the users, whilst at the 
same time providing advanced features for which a large number of users would be willing to pay.
Advertisement-based applications display advertisements on the screen as users interact with the 
applications. This strategy for revenue generation is more effective if the applications are used for 
relatively long periods of time. The user interface designers must take care when displaying the 
advertisements. They must be prominent enough without hiding essential parts of the application and 
they must ensure that users are not distracted and dislike using the application.
Transaction-based applications charge the users either per transaction, a flat fee or a percentage of 
the transaction value or similar. This type of business model is suitable for a limited number of 
applications only and is usually applied for business and financial apps such as mobile wallets.
Fee-based applications require the users to pay for downloading and installing the application. 
Deciding on a fee-based business model should be well-considered since large numbers of free or 
freemium options exist for most application types. The probability of users buying such an app 
increases if it provides outstanding features or usability, or when competing applications are not 
available.
Free and enterprise applications do not charge their users. Enterprise applications are developed for 
internal use within the organization and provide an interface to the services provided. There are many 
such apps available from organizations such as banks or e-commerce companies. These apps are not 
generally focused on monetizing the app itself but allow revenue to be generated by directing users to
the services provided by the organizations.
1.3 Mobile Device Types
There is a variety of mobile devices available that support different types of applications.

Typical devices include:
● Basic phones
● Feature phones
● Smartphones
● Tablets
● Companion devices - including wearables and some IoT (Internet of Things) devices.
When testing it should be kept in mind that each type of device has specific features for particular
needs.
Basic phones are used for telephone and SMS only and provide very few built-in apps and games. 
The installation of apps or browsing is not possible.
Feature phones provide limited support for apps and app installation. They provide internet access via 
a built-in browser and may have some additional hardware such as cameras.
Smartphones provide phones with several sensors. The operating system supports features such as 
application installation, multimedia support and browsing.
Tablets are similar to smartphones but are physically larger. They are typically used when a larger
display is needed or desired and they may also support longer battery life.
Companion devices and some IoT appliances are computer-powered devices commonly used 
together with a smartphone or tablet to extend the available functionality or to give access to the data 
on the phone or tablet in a more convenient way.
Wearables are devices that can be worn by consumers. These can act as a companion to existing 
devices or function independently. Watches and fitness bands are examples of popular wearables.
1.4 Types of Mobile Applications
There are three main types of mobile application:
● Native
● Browser-based
● Hybrid
Each type of application has certain advantages and disadvantages, requiring a business decision to 
be made before starting the application development.
Native applications are developed using platform specific software development kits (SDKs), 
development tools and platform specific sensors and features. They are downloaded, installed and 
updated from supplier stores. These apps may need testing on all supported devices.
Native applications generally provide better performance, can fully utilize platform features and comply 
to the expectations for the platform they are developed for. The development cost is typically higher 
and additional challenges may apply such as the use of multiple platforms and the installation and 
testing on a large number of devices.
Browser-based applications are accessed through a mobile browser. Since these use the typical webdevelopment technologies and browsers, multiple platform support is easy, and the development cost 
is usually lower.
There are four main ways in which mobile web applications are created:
● Mobile specific versions of websites and applications (these are also known as m(dot) sites). 
Usually this means that when a mobile browser addresses the application, a mobile version of 
Certified Tester Specialist

the application is provided. For example, facebook.com redirects to m.facebook.com when 
accessed from a mobile device.
● Responsive web apps ensure that the design adjusts to the form factor and screen size, 
usually expressed as view ports.
● Adaptive web apps adjust the design according to some predefined sizes. There are different 
designs for these sizes and the features available to the user are often adjustable.
● Progressive web apps allow shortcuts of specific web pages to be created on the mobile 
home screen. They appear like native apps and sometimes even can work offline.
Mobile web apps are created using common web technologies, which generally makes them easier to 
develop and manage compared to native and hybrid apps. They may however not be as feature-rich 
as native or hybrid apps and may have limited access to the platform’s native Application 
Programming Interfaces (APIs). The access to mobile sensors is also limited. Installability testing on 
devices is not needed, but browser compatibility testing is required.
Hybrid applications are a combination of native app and web app. They use a native app wrapper 
which contains a web view to run a web application inside of a native app. These apps are 
downloaded from supplier stores and can access all of the device features. They are relatively easy to 
develop, update and maintain without updating the app installed on the device. The skills required for 
developing these apps are almost the same as for web development. Possible weak points for these
apps include performance issues due to the use of a wrapper and possible divergences from the 
expected look and feel because of platform-specific aspects.
Native and hybrid apps are installed physically on a device and are therefore always available to the 
user, even when the device has no internet connection. In comparison, browser-based applications 
require internet access.
Some applications are pre-installed on the mobile device and others can be installed via various 
distribution channels, such as Apple App Store, Google Play Store, enterprise app stores (available 
only inside the enterprise network) and third-party app markets.
Testing of each of these application types may require a different approach. The parameters to 
consider include:
● Different types of devices to be supported
● Sensor and device features to be used
● Availability under various network conditions
● Installability, compatibility, performance efficiency, and usability
1.5 Mobile Application Architecture
There are multiple solutions to designing a mobile application.
Some of the considerations in choosing a particular architecture or design decision include:
● Target audience
● Type of application
● Support of various mobile and non-mobile platforms
● Connectivity needs
● Data storage needs
● Connections to other devices including IoT appliances
Certified Tester Specialist
Mobile Application Testing Foundation Level
Syllabus
Version 2019 Page 15 of 51

Architectural decisions include:
● Client-side architecture such as thin or fat client
● Server-side architecture such as single or multi-tier
● Connection type such as Wi-Fi, cellular data, Near Field Communication (NFC), Bluetooth
● Data synchronization methods such as store-and-forward, push and pull, synchronous 
and asynchronous communications
Thin client apps do not contain application code which is customized to the device and make minimal 
use of mobile operating system features. These apps typically use the web browser as the front-end 
and JavaScript as the language for implementing client-side logic.
Thick/fat client applications may have multiple layers of application code and may use mobile 
operating system features. These are typically Native or Hybrid applications.
The server-side architectures include the following possibilities:
● Single-tier architectures are monolithic and have all servers on the same machine. They
are less scalable and harder to secure.
● Multi-tier architectures spread server-side components across various units. Two-tier 
architectures involve separate web and database servers, whereas three-tier architectures 
also include an application server. Multi-tier architectures allow separation of 
responsibilities, provide database specialization and provide better flexibility, scalability 
and security. However, they may be significantly more expensive to develop, manage and 
host compared to single-tier architectures.
There are various connection methods. A mobile device might be connected to the server via 
connection types such as Wi-Fi or via cellular data connections such as 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G. Mobile 
applications typically operate in one of the following three modes:
● Never-connected apps work offline and don’t need to be connected. A simple calculator is 
an example of such an app.
● Always-connected apps require a permanent network connection during operation. All 
mobile web applications fall into this category, although some can operate in a limited way 
when partially connected.
● Partially-connected apps require a connection for tasks such as data transfer but can 
operate for long periods of time without connection.
The synchronization of data between the client and the server can be conducted in the following 
modes:
● Continuous mode is where the data gets transferred as soon as it is submitted.
● Store-and-forward mode is where the data may be stored locally before being transferred, 
especially when no connectivity is available.
The data transfer can be performed in the following two approaches:
● Synchronous data transfer is performed when the calling function waits for the called 
function to complete before returning.
● Asynchronous data transfer is performed when the called server function returns 
immediately, processes the data in the background and calls back the calling client 
function once it completes the task. This give users more control. However, implementing

the handshake mechanism increases complexity concerning the availability of the client or 
the network when the server initiates the callback.
1.6 Test Strategy for Mobile Apps
Creating a test strategy for mobile devices requires the tester to take into account all the parameters 
listed so far in this chapter. In addition, the risks discussed in this section and the challenges 
described in section 1.7 must also be considered.
Typical risks are, for example:
● Without knowing the device proliferation data in a particular geographic location, one 
cannot choose the devices on which the app needs to be tested in a sustainable fashion.
● Without knowing the type of business model, one cannot test whether the application 
behavior is a good fit for that business model.
Creating a test strategy for mobile application testing additionally needs to consider the following
specific risks and challenges:
● The variety of mobile devices with device-specific defects on some of them.
● The availability of devices in-house or via the use of external test labs.
● The introduction of new technologies, devices and/or platforms during the application life 
cycle.
● The installation and upgrade of the app itself via various channels, including preserving 
app data and preferences.
● Platform issues which might impact the application.
● Network coverage and its impact on the app in a global context.
● The ability to test using the networks of various service providers.
● The use of mobile emulators, simulators and/or real devices for specific test levels and 
types of test.
These challenges are described in greater detail in the section 1.7.
The test strategy takes risks and challenges into account. For example:
● The test strategy may specify the use of mobile emulators/simulators in the early stages of 
development, followed by real devices in later stages. There are certain types of tests that 
can be performed on the mobile emulators/simulators but not all types of tests. More on 
this is described in section 4.3.
● The test strategy may consider the challenge posed by a large number of different devices 
by adopting one of the following approaches:
o Single platform approach: Reduce scope to a single type of device, one OS 
version, one carrier and one network type.
o Multi-platform approach: Reduce scope to a representative selection of devices 
and OS used by a majority of customers in the target market, based on mobile 
traffic or other analytical data.
Certified Tester Specialist
Mobile Application Testing Foundation Level
Syllabus
Version 2019 Page 17 of 51

o Maximum coverage approach: Cover all OS versions, devices, manufacturers, 
carriers and network types. This is basically exhaustive testing, which is usually 
not economically viable, especially when considering the multitude of devices and 
OS versions on the market.
● The test strategy may consider the challenge posed by the non-availability of devices, 
networks or real-life conditions by using external resources, such as:
o Remote device access services. This is a way to access devices over the web 
which are not otherwise owned.
o Crowd testing services. This is as a way to access a huge group of volunteers
and their devices.
o Personal networks such as friends and colleagues. This makes use of one’s own 
private social network.
o Bug hunting. This is gamified testing event using volunteers from the company or 
from the general public.
In addition to the test levels described in [ISTQB_CTFL_2018] the test strategy also considers the 
common types of testing used for mobile applications (see section 3.1) and any additional levels of 
testing required (see section 3.2).
1.7 Challenges of Mobile Application Testing
In the mobile world many additional challenges exist that are uncommon or uncritical in desktop or 
server software. Testers must be aware of these challenges and how they might impact the success of 
the application.
Typical challenges in the mobile world include:
● Multiple platforms and device fragmentation: Multiple OS types and versions, screen sizes 
and quality of display.
● Hardware differences in various devices: Various types of sensors and difficulty in 
simulating test conditions for constrained CPU and RAM resources.
● Variety of software development tools required by the platforms.
● Difference of user interface designs and user experience (UX) expectations from the
platforms.
● Multiple network types and providers.
● Resource-starved devices.
● Various distribution channels for apps.
● Diverse users and user groups.
● Various app types with various connection methods.
● High feedback visibility resulting from bugs that have a high impact on users which may 
easily result in them publishing feedback on online market places.
● Market place publishing which requires additional approval cycles for publishing by market 
place owners such as Google Play or Apple App Store.
Certified Tester Specialist
Mobile Application Testing Foundation Level

© International Software Testing Qualifications Board
● Unavailability of newly launched devices requiring the use of mobile emulators/simulators
The impact of these challenges includes:
● Large numbers of combinations to be tested.
● Large numbers of devices required for testing, which drives up the cost.
● The need for backward compatibility to run the application on older versions of the 
platform.
● New features being released in every version of underlying operating system.
● Guidelines to be considered for the various platforms.
● Resource-starved CPUs as well as limited amount of memory and storage space.
● Varying bandwidth and jitter of various networks.
● Changes in the available upload and download speeds based on data plans.
The following two examples illustrate typical challenges and their potential impact:
● Different devices have different types of sensors and tests need to account for these. 
Every new sensor added to the hardware may require additional backward compatibility 
testing.
● Some of the network challenges can be dealt with appropriately, even under varying 
network conditions, by using appropriate caching and prefetching strategies. However, 
this comes at a cost; a large number of open connections can impact the server-side 
performance as most apps keep the user logged-in on the server.
1.8 Risks in Mobile Application Testing
The challenges mentioned in section 1.7 can appear in isolation or in combination with others. This 
may result in additional risks for a mobile application.
A tester must be able to contribute to the product risk analysis. Common risk analysis and mitigation 
methods, as discussed in [ISTQB_CTFL_2018], chapter 5.5, can also be applied in the mobile 
context. In addition, the following mobile-specific risks and mitigation strategies exist:
Risk Possible mitigation
Market fragmentation Choose an appropriate selection of devices for test 
execution, e.g., testing the most commonly used devices.
Cost of supporting multiple platforms Perform analysis to understand most used platforms, thus 
avoiding testing of those no longer in scope.
Introduction of new technologies, 
platforms and devices
Use pre-production versions of those technologies.
Lack of availability of devices for test 
execution
Apply remote device access services or crowd testing 
services.
Risks from the expected usage 
patterns of mobile applications used 
while on the go

2.1 Testing for Compatibility with Device Hardware
2.1.1 Testing for Device Features
Different types of devices with differing capabilities mean that compatibility testing has to be
conducted on a large number of devices. This requires prioritization of target devices for testing. For 
prioritization market data, as discussed in section 1.1, is used to select a device portfolio most 
appropriate for the target market. The device portfolio selection usually is a compromise between 
market coverage, cost and risk.
Applications can be installed on different types of devices with the following features:
● Different methods for switching off
● Different ways to navigate
● Use of hard and soft keyboards
● Various hardware features such as:
o Radio
o USB
o Bluetooth
o Cameras
o Speakers
o Microphone
o Headphone access 
None of these features should interfere negatively with the application’s operations. 
Device features have many variations and can differ even between different device models made by
the same manufacturer. They are commonly used to differentiate between market segments and can 
change quickly over time. For example, it is currently quite common for devices in the high-end and 
mid-range to have fingerprint sensors, while devices in the low-end do not. This changes over time. A 
few years ago, fingerprint sensors were not included in any mobile device at all. Due to this
changeability, the tester needs a clear understanding of the devices and the features expected by its 
users. The tester needs to create the device portfolio and design corresponding tests accordingly.
Generally, it is not enough to test if the application works correctly with the expected features. In 
addition, it is required to test that the app still works as expected if a certain feature is absent. For

example, an app that supports the usage of front and rear camera should not crash if it is installed and 
executed on a device having multiple cameras, only one camera or no camera at all.
2.1.2 Testing for Different Displays
Device displays can have various screen sizes, viewport sizes, aspect ratios and resolutions 
measured in pixels per inch (ppi) and dots per inch (dpi). Device fragmentation requires prioritization 
to be performed. Tests should be created that exercise the user interface on various devices with 
different screen sizes, resolutions and aspect ratios most common in the target market.
Testing for different displays needs to be carried out to check the following:
● The app scales all user interface elements according to current screen density and size. 
● User interface elements do not overlap.
● Usability or touch issues do not occur.
● There is no problematic shrinkage of images because of high dpi/ppi.
2.1.3 Testing for Device Temperature
Unlike desktop computers, mobile devices react differently to increases in device temperature.
Mobile devices could get overheated for a variety of reasons such as battery charging, intense 
workload, apps running in the background, continuous usage of cellular data, Wi-Fi or GPS. 
Overheating can impact a device as it attempts to reduce heating and conserve battery levels. This 
may include a drop in the CPU frequency, the freeing up of memory, and the turning off parts of the 
system.
If this happens it can also impact the app functionality and therefore must be considered when 
planning testing. Tests must be designed to consume a lot of energy which leads to the generation of 
heat over a long uninterrupted period of time. The software under test must then show no unexpected 
behavior. 
2.1.4 Testing for Device Input Sensors
Mobile devices receive a variety of inputs types from sensors which use, for example, GPS, 
accelerometers, gyroscopes, and 3-axis magnetometers or which react to pressure, temperature,
humidity, heartbeat, light or touchless inputs.
Testing for different device input sensors checks the following:
● The app works as intended for each of the sensors available. For example, the app needs to 
be tested for various types of motion such as circular motion and back and forth motion (as in 
walking). 
● Features that react to external lighting react correctly under various lighting conditions. 
● Sound inputs and outputs respond correctly in conjunction with soft and hard volume buttons, 
microphones, wired and wireless speakers, and in various ambient sound conditions.
● Location position is accurate under the following conditions:
o Switching GPS on and off.
o Different GPS signal quality.
o Where the app needs a fall back to various other methods of location determination, 
including Wi-Fi, cell tower location or manual location entry.

2.1.5 Testing Various Input Methods
Testing for different device input methods checks the following:
● Given that mobile phones allow for a variety of soft keyboards to be installed, the app is able 
to work with at least those provided by major device manufacturers and those which are 
widely used.
● The app ensures that the keyboard pops up by default with appropriate layout and keys when 
required. 
● When a user places one or more fingers on the touch screen, the application interprets that 
pattern as a particular gesture or command. Typical gestures include press/touch, double 
touch, multi-touch, swipe, tap, double tap, drag, and pinch open/close.
● Each screen of the app needs responds correctly to the gestures or other means of input as 
appropriate for that screen and ignores all non-supported gestures or inputs. 
● Cameras used by apps are able to capture images and videos, scan barcodes, QR codes and
documents, and measure distances. 
● Where front and back cameras are available, the appropriate camera is turned on by default. 
For example, where a video chat requires the front camera to be switched on by default, apps
need to be tested in cases where the app uses the camera input and where it does not. 
Additionally, tests must ensure the software under test works correctly if only one (front or 
rear) camera is present instead of two. This is especially true if the software under test uses 
one particular camera and it is this one that is missing.
2.1.6 Testing for Screen Orientation Change
Motions sensors are used to detect changes in orientation and trigger a switch between landscape 
and portrait modes (and vice versa) with layout changes made in the user interface as necessary. 
Tests after a change of screen orientation check the following:
● Correct usability and functional behavior when a switch to either portrait or landscape mode is 
performed.
● The app maintains its state.
● Input data fields retain already captured data.
● Output data fields display the same data while maintaining the current session.
Tests after a change of screen orientation change should not just focus on a single switch because
rendering or state issues may not always show up after a single change. Tests should therefore be 
performed with several uninterrupted switches between portrait and landscape modes.
Tests that switches orientation several times in the various states of a user interface, with and without 
data, should be designed. The app should behave as expected, persisting the state without any loss 
or change of data.
2.1.7 Testing for Typical Interrupts
Common types of device interrupts include voice calls, messages, charger switched on, low memory 
and other notifications. User-initiated interrupts result from actions such as app switching or setting the 
device into standby while the app is running
Tests for interrupts check the following:
Certified Tester Specialist
Mobile Application Testing Foundation Level
Syllabus
Version 2019 Page 23 of 51

© International Software Testing Qualifications Board
● The app handles the all of the interrupts mentioned above correctly without negative impact 
on app behavior.
● The app continues to function correctly, preserving its state, data and sessions regardless of 
which interrupt occurs.
● Where the device has a blocking “do-not-disturb” mode which suppresses notifications, the 
app must ensure that the various conditions are used correctly. These tests must also be 
performed when the “do-not-disturb” mode is turned off after having been active for a long
period of time. This results in many notifications being received at once. 
● Test should be designed for receiving interrupts during app usage to make sure that the 
interrupts do not have a negative impact. For example, answering a phone call while using the 
app and the user being returned to the state where he was at the time of the interrupt. 
2.1.8 Testing for Access Permissions to Device Features
Apps need access to various folders such as contacts and pictures and to sensors such as camera
and microphone. When access is denied at installation or changed after installation it might impact the 
app behavior. 
Tests for access permissions check the following:
• The app is able to work with reduced permissions; it asks the user to grant these permissions 
and does not fail in an unexplained manner. 
• Permissions are only requested for the resources which are relevant to the app’s functionality; 
no broad permissions for unrelated resources are allowed.
• The app functionality responds correctly if a permission is withdrawn or rejected during 
installation. 
• Any request for permission issued by the app is correct and justified.
To test for access permissions a tester needs to know why the app needs each permission and how 
functionality should be impacted if the permission is withdrawn or rejected during installation. Test 
should be designed for rejecting permissions during installation as well as granting permissions after 
installation.
2.1.9 Testing for Power Consumption and State
Tests for power consumption and state check the following:
• Battery power state and drainage-related defects.
• Data integrity under low power and dead battery conditions. 
• Power consumption while the app is active and is under heavy and low use.
• Power consumption while the app is in the background.
These tests need to be planned carefully as these need to be run uninterrupted over an extended 
period of time. For example, the device may need to be left unattended with the app in the 
background or foreground but the device is not used. Tools such as log analyzers are needed to 
extract information about battery drain patterns.
2.2 Testing for App Interactions with Device Software
2.2.1 Testing for Notifications
There are various mechanisms used by the operating system to display notifications. Sometimes the 
operating system will either delay the display of the notifications or fail to display them at all in a bid to 
optimize power consumption. The following test conditions must be considered:
Certified Tester Specialist
Mobile Application Testing Foundation Level
Syllabus
Version 2019 Page 24 of 51
3 May 2019
© International Software Testing Qualifications Board
• The correct handling of notifications received when the app is in the foreground or 
background, especially under low battery conditions. 
• If notifications allow direct interaction with the app content, (i.e., without opening the app 
itself), the user interaction must be provided by the app at a later time. If, for example, the 
user responds to a notification, then it must be possible to access that response from within 
the app at a later time. 
• If notifications allow access to the app then the corresponding page of the app must be
opened instead of the home screen when the notification contains a deep link to that page. 
2.2.2 Testing for Quick-access Links
Quick-access links such as app shortcuts in Android and Force-touch or 3d-touch for iOS may be 
provided by the software under test. These features perform a subset of the application functionality 
from the home screen without actually launching the entire app. 
The following test conditions must be considered:
• Where some of the features are only available on a particular version of the operating system, 
the system under test must behave correctly if it is installed on versions of the operating 
system which either offer or do not offer such features. 
• The actions performed in quick-access links are reflected correctly in the app when opened.
2.2.3 Testing for User Preferences Provided by the Operating System
Any preferences (settings) provided to users by the operating system must be tested. It creates a 
negative experience for users if a certain preference setting is not respected by the app. For example,
if the device is set to mute, the app should not play sounds.
The following test conditions must be considered:
• Users can amend typical preference options such as sound, brightness, network, power save 
mode, date and time, time zone, languages, access type and notifications. 
• The apps adhere to the set preferences by behaving accordingly. 
2.2.4 Testing for Different Types of Apps
Specific tests may be performed depending on type of mobile app (see section 1.4). The following test 
conditions must be considered:
● For native apps:
o Device compatibility 
o Utilization of device features
● For hybrid apps:
o Interaction of the app with the device native features
o Potential performance issues due to the abstraction layer
o Usability (look and feel) compared to native apps on the platform in question
● For web apps:
o Testing to determine cross-browser compatibility of the app to various common 
mobile browsers
o Functionality is not impacted due to various JavaScript engines
o Utilization of OS features (e.g., date picker and opening appropriate keyboard)
o Usability (look and feel) compared to native apps on the platform in question

2.2.5 Testing for Interoperability with Multiple Platforms and Operating System Versions
Software companies often support apps on multiple operating systems. Each mobile operating system
has its own limitations which need to be taken into account when testing apps. Testers must be aware 
of the specifics of each platform tested to ensure the app works as intended whilst still conforming to 
the look and feel of the platform.
The following test conditions must be considered:
● Handling of interrupts, notifications and optimizations (e.g., for energy saving).
● Correct functionality where multi-platform applications share some code or have been created 
using cross-platform development frameworks. Note that if the applications do not share code, 
then it is like testing two different applications and everything needs to be tested. 
● Testing for backward compatibility if a platform uses different operating system versions. 
● Testing new or changed features made to platforms. For example, in Android the introduction 
of the Doze framework required testing on the various versions of the operating system which 
support this framework and those that don't.
2.2.6 Testing for Interoperability and Co-existence with other Apps on the Device
It is quite common for apps to interact with each other when installed on a device. Typical examples 
are the contact and email apps. 
The following test conditions must be considered:
● Data transfer between the system under test and the utilized app is correct. 
● There is no harm done to any user data stored within a utilized app.
● Conflicting behaviors. For example, an app might turn off GPS to save energy, while another
app turns on GPS automatically. 
With millions of apps in the market, co-existence cannot realistically be tested for all of them.
Nevertheless, such potential issues should be considered and tested according to their risk.
2.3 Testing for Various Connectivity Methods
Mobile devices can use various methods to connect to networks (see section 1.5). These include 
cellular networks such as 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G, as well as Wi-Fi and other wireless connection types 
such as NFC or Bluetooth. 
The following alternatives should be considered when performing tests for connectivity:
● Device emulators/simulators can simulate various network connections and some remote 
device access service providers include them within their features. Emulators/simulators are, 
however, of limited value. 
● Setting up your own mobile network to support various connection types and then applying
bandwidth manipulation. This is a very costly alternative. 
● Field testing is potentially more cost-effective alternative, but is limited with regard to the 
reproduction of tests.
In real-world usage, connectivity methods differ. Users can be continuously connected using one 
particular mode, or they can switch between modes, such as from Wi-Fi to cellular (e.g., when a user 
leaves home while using the app). The user can switch between various Wi-Fi/cellular networks and 
versions, as well as between GSM cells. While on the move they may even hit dead spots with no 
network at all. Furthermore, the user can deliberately disconnect by, for example, switching to flight 
mode.

Connectivity testing must ensure that the following test conditions are considered:
● Correct app functionality with different connectivity modes.
● Switching between modes does not cause any unexpected behavior or data loss. 
● Clear information is given to the user if functionality is restricted due to limited or no network 
connection or if bandwidth is low. The message should state the limitations and their reasons.

3.1 Common Test Types Applicable for Mobile Application
3.1.1 Installability Testing
Testers need to focus on installation, update and de-installation of the app using the following 
approaches:
● Application stores
The installation process may be different depending on the users of the app. The users could 
install the app from market place stores such as the Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store. 
The users of enterprise apps will be required to perform installation tests via a link, or a 
distribution service such as HockeyApp or App Center.
● Sideloading (copying and installing app)
Some operating systems provide the option of installing the application by copying it to a
mobile device and installing it from the file.
● Desktop applications 
Desktop applications such as Apple iTunes (for iOS) or Android App Installer are available for 
installing apps on the smartphone. The tester needs to download the app in this application 
and use a cable to install it from there to the smartphone. Most of these desktop applications 
also allow de-installation of the app.
Installation can be performed using the following methods:
● OTA (Over-the-Air) via Wi-Fi or Cellular Data
● Data cable
Some of the test conditions that can be considered include:
● Installation, de-installation and upgrade on internal and external memory (if supported).
● Re-installation of app when the “retain app data” option was chosen during the previous deinstallation.
● Re-installation of app when the “retain app data” option was not chosen during the previous 
de-installation.
● Cancelling or interrupting the installation or de-installation, for example, by shutting down the 
mobile device during the process or disconnecting from the internet.
● Resuming interrupted installation, de-installation and upgrade after cancelling or interrupting.
● Permissions-related testing. For example, some apps request permission to use the address 
book. This important test must verify app behavior if the user denies permission. For example, 
is there a corresponding message sent to the user?
● Update the app and verify that no data is lost.
Some apps require jailbroken (iOS) or rooted (Android) devices which give the user the administrative 
rights over the device. Most platform providers do not support jailbreaking/rooting as it may have legal 
consequences. An app not requiring jailbreaking/rooting may not need to be tested for the 
jailbreaking/rooting devices.
3.1.2 Stress Testing
Stress testing is focused on determining the performance efficiency of the application when subjected 
to conditions beyond normal load. The stress test is this context is targeted only at the mobile device. 
Stress tests of the backend are described in the ISTQB® Performance Testing syllabus
([ISTQB_CTFL_PT_2018]) so that further information can be referenced there as needed.
Certified Tester Specialist
Mobile Application Testing Foundation Level
Syllabus
Version 2019 Page 29 of 51

© International Software Testing Qualifications Board
Some of the test conditions that can be considered for stress testing include: 
● high CPU-usage
● out-of-memory
● low disk space
● battery stress
● failures
● poor bandwidth
● very high number of user interactions (real world network conditions may need to be simulated 
for this)
Some of these stressful conditions can be created using tools such as Monkey. This is a command 
line tool that runs over the ADB shell command line [URL3] or, if possible, manually, e.g., by using big 
files or other apps with high CPU-usage or memory consumption.
3.1.3 Security Testing
Since security testing is a complex topic, the ISTQB® has a separate specialist syllabus on this subject
[ISTQB_CTAL_SEC_2016]. Principal security issues for mobile apps include:
● Access to sensitive data on the device.
● Unencrypted information transfer or unsafe storage. 
Some of the test conditions that can be considered for security testing include:
● Testing inputs for code injection and overflow.
● Encryption of transferred data.
● Encryption of locally stored data.
● Deletion of temporary data after use or after an abnormal end.
● Clearing text in password fields.
Top 10 mobile related vulnerabilities from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) 
should also be explored [URL2].
3.1.4 Performance Testing
If the user installs the app and it does not appear fast enough (e.g., less than or equal to 3 seconds) it 
may get de-installed in favor of another alternative app. Time and resource consumption aspects are 
important success factors for an app and performance testing is carried out to measure these aspects.
Performance efficiency needs to be tested on the device itself in addition to interaction with the 
backend system and other mobile devices.
Performance testing of the whole system should be performed as defined in the test strategy and is 
not mobile specific. Please refer to the ISTQB® specialist syllabus on performance testing 
[ISTQB_CTFL_PT_2018] for further details.
The performance test of the app itself should contain chronometry for the most important workflows. 
Some examples for the workflows of an online-banking app are: “Login”, “Change address” or “Bank 
transfer with PIN and TAN”. The tester should then compare this chronometry with similar apps.
Besides chronometric measures it is important to consider the perceived performance by the user. 
User experience can have a huge impact on how long the user is willing to wait for a certain function 
to complete.

3.1.5 Usability Testing
Usability is very important for mobile apps because data shows that a large number of users de-install 
their apps within a few minutes of installing because of poor usability or performance, see [URL4].
Due to this it is recommended that user experience (UX) design considers the look and feel of the 
platform which the app is to be used on. If the UX does not conform with the user’s expectations for 
their platform of choice, it can have a strong negative impact. Thus, a tester should be aware of the 
look and feel on the platform used.
Usability tests can be conducted by a tester using various available heuristics and test tours. 
Considering personas is also a helpful support for usability testing. If required, a usability lab can also 
be used for this purpose.
In projects, findings identified during the usability test are mostly just findings and not defects. The 
tester must have the ability to explain the findings to the team, Product Owner or similar stakeholders. 
To achieve satisfactory usability, an app should:
● be self-explanatory and intuitive.
● allow user mistakes.
● be consistent in wording and behavior.
● abide by the design guidelines of the platforms.
● make needed information visible and reachable in each screen size and type.
Please refer to the ISTQB® specialist syllabus in usability testing [ISTQB_FLUT_2018] for further 
details.
3.1.6 Database Testing
Many apps need to store data locally using various data storage mechanisms such as flat files or 
databases. Some of the test conditions to be considered for the database testing of mobile apps 
include:
● Validation of data storage issues:
o Synchronization
o Upload conflicts
o Data security
o Constraints on the data
o CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) functionality
o Search
● Data integration testing for data provided by the device (e.g., contacts) or by third-party apps 
(e.g., pictures, videos and messages).
● Performance of storing the data on the device.
3.1.7 Globalization and Localization Testing
Internationalization (I18N) /Globalization testing of the application includes testing an app for different 
locations, formats for dates, numbers and currency, and replacing actual strings with pseudo-strings.
Localization (L10N) testing includes the testing of an app with localized strings, images and workflows 
for a particular region. For example, Russian and German words could be much longer than those in 
other languages. Since mobile devices have different screen sizes and resolutions, limited screen
sizes may lead to problems with translated strings. These issues should be checked as standard
globalization/localization tests.
A very important aspect to be checked is the date format used, such as YEAR – MONTH – DAY or 
DAY – MONTH – YEAR.

3.1.8 Accessibility Testing
Accessibility testing is performed to determine the ease by which users with disabilities can use a 
component or system. For mobile apps this can be done using device accessibility settings and testing 
the app for each setting.
Accessibility guidelines are available from platform vendors and these should be used. For example, 
both Google [URL5] and Apple [URL6] have published accessibility guidelines for their respective 
platforms. Taking feedback from people who require accessibility is also helpful.
For mobile web an accessibility guide has been published by the W3C, which should be considered 
[URL7].
3.2 Additional Test Levels applicable for Mobile Applications
In addition to the usual levels of testing from component through to acceptance testing described in 
[ISTQB_CTFL_2018], there is also a need for additional test levels for mobile application testing.
3.2.1 Field Testing
Some mobile applications need field testing to ensure that they function correctly in the expected 
usage scenario of real users. This could include testing on various networks and on different types of 
communication technologies such as Wi-Fi or cellular data.
Field tests should include the use of mobile towers, networks, Wi-Fi, and cellular data switching while 
the app is in use. Tests should be performed with varying download speeds and signal strengths, and 
include the handling of blind spots.
Field testing requires careful planning and the identification of all items required to perform the tests, 
such as appropriate device types, Wi-Fi, cellular data plans on various carriers and access to various 
modes of transport required to give adequate coverage. In addition, the routes and modes of 
transport, and the time of the day when the tests are to be executed need to be scheduled.
Usability of an app is another important aspect that needs to be covered while conducting field testing. 
Tests should incorporate environmental factors such as temperature and similar conditions related to 
usage scenario.
3.2.2 Testing for Application Store Approval and Post-release Testing
Before an app is sent for publishing some checklist/based tests must be passed to assure the 
approval of the application stores. If the release is an upgrade, then upgrade related tests should also 
be run.
Checklists are typically based on guidelines, such as those specific to operating systems, for user 
interface design, and for using the libraries and APIs provided by application stores.
The approval process may take some time after submission. If any issues are found during the 
approval process, a new version may need to be submitted, which will require additional time to 
resolve. This situation requires careful consideration during project planning and testing.
A further level of testing is “post-release” testing. Testing at this level includes downloading and 
installing the application from application stores.
3.3 Experience-based Testing Techniques
3.3.1 Personas and Mnemonics
Personas are fictional characters which represent real customers. They have motivations, 
expectations, problems, habits and goals and it helps to use them when real user behavior needs to 
be mimicked.
Certified Tester Specialist
Mobile Application Testing Foundation Level
Syllabus
Version 2019 Page 32 of 51
3 May 2019
© International Software Testing Qualifications Board
A persona could have a name, gender, age, income, an educational background, and a location. In a 
mobile context they may use other apps, check their mobile device x times an hour and can have
other devices and personal traits.
A mnemonic is a memory aid to remember something. In the context of testing, every letter in a 
mnemonic stands for a technique, a testing method or a focal point for testing. An example of a 
mnemonic is SFiDPOT [URL8]. Letters in the mnemonic have the following meanings:
S – Structure (e.g., user interface elements, other application elements and their order and call 
hierarchy)
F – Function (e.g., desired features are working, available, and functioning according to the 
requirements etc.)
i - Input (e.g., all required inputs are available and processed as they should be, such as inputs from 
the keyboard, sensors, and camera)
D – Data (e.g., the data is stored (also on SD card), modified, added, and deleted as defined in the 
requirements)
P – Platform (e.g., the specific operating system functions are available depending on device settings, 
includes store for downloading the app)
O – Operations (e.g., the activities of the normal user are available, such as moving between mobile 
carrier networks and Wi-Fi)
T – Time (e.g., handling and display of time zones, time, and dates)
A mnemonic and heuristic specifically dealing with mobile is I SLICED UP FUN [URL9]. Letters in the 
mnemonic have the following meanings
I – Inputs
S – Store
L – Location
I – Interactions and interruptions
C – Communication
E – Ergonomics
D – Data
U – Usability
P – Platform
F – Function
U – User scenarios
N – Network
3.3.2 Heuristics
A heuristic approach is a “rule of thumb” approach to problem solving, learning and discovery that 
employs a practical method. This does not guarantee to be optimal or perfect, but can be considered 
as sufficient for achieving the immediate goals.
There are many heuristics for mobile testing. Most mnemonics can be used as heuristics, but not 
every heuristic is a mnemonic.
3.3.3 Tours
Certified Tester Specialist
Mobile Application Testing Foundation Level
Syllabus
Version 2019 Page 33 of 51
3 May 2019
© International Software Testing Qualifications Board
Tours are used in exploratory testing to enable an application to be explored from a specific point of 
view and focus. They can be performed to understand how an application works and to create models 
for the workflow. Tours provide an effective method for field testing. 
An example of a tour is the Landmark tour where a user mimics the visits of a tourist in a city by going
to well-known landmarks. The following table shows how visits made on the tour can be used as 
analogies for the steps to follow in mobile testing. 
Visits in the Landmark tour Analogy for mobile testing
The historical quarter Legacy code
The business district 
Rush hour
Business logic of the app 
App startup and shutdown
The tourist quarter Part of the app used by newcomers
The hotel quarter Parts of the app which are only active in sleep mode
Combining session-based testing (see section 3.3.4) with tours, including the use of heuristics and 
mnemonics, helps in enhancing the effectiveness of mobile application testing.
The following table shows some good examples of tours for app testing and the areas they cover for 
giving testing ideas. Some of these are to be found in [Kohl17].
Tour for app testing Subject covered
Supermodel Look and feel and usability
Landmark The most important features in the app
Sabotage Robustness
Feature New features
Scenario Whole workflow in the app in combination with user stories
Connectivity Connectivity used, such as Wi-Fi, GSM
Location Correct language, dates, numbers
Light Visibility in different lighting conditions, such as dark, outside, red light.

3.3.4 Session-Based Test Management (SBTM)
Session-based test management (SBTM) enables exploratory testing to be managed in a time-boxed 
fashion. A session consists of three tasks:
● Session setup
● Test design and execution
● Issue investigation and reporting
SBTM typically uses a session sheet containing a test charter that provides test objectives. 
Additionally, the session sheet is used to document the test execution activities carried out.
Exploratory testing is an experience-based test technique which can be an effective approach for 
testing mobile applications. Experience-based test techniques are described in [ISTQB_CTFL_2018].
3.4 Mobile Test Process and Approaches

3.4.2 Test Approaches
Mobile application testing includes activities to be performed by developers as well as testers.
Determining the appropriate depth of testing per test level, (i.e., component test, integration test, 
system test, field test, application store approval, post-release and user acceptance testing) are 
important for delivering good quality products. The depth of testing needed per test level depends on 
many factors, such as app architecture, app complexity and intended user audience.
Mobile development platforms provide a variety tools to support testing at the various levels. 
Understanding the tools and how they can be applied at a given level are very important. For example, 
a mobile simulator and/or mobile emulator can be used at the component testing level if there is a 
need to take advantage of the platform-provided framework and instrumentation APIs. In addition, 
mobile simulators and/or mobile emulators can be used at the system testing level when actual 
devices are not available. This enables testing for functionality, limited aspects of usability as well as 
the user interface.
Furthermore, early implementation can serve as a key point to ensure that the devices are setup 
correctly and all the prerequisites for the execution will be met on time.
Unit and integration tests are also important, as well as manual testing, (especially in the field-testing 
stage). It is very common for mobile apps to flip the Test Pyramid [Knott15]. This means that there can 
be many manual tests.

4.1 Development Platforms for Mobile Applications
Integrated development environments (IDEs) are available on the market for various mobile app 
developments. These IDEs have various tools that help in designing, coding, compiling, installing, deinstalling, monitoring, emulating, logging and testing apps.
For example, Android Studio may be used for Android app development and for iOS app development 
Xcode may be used. These differ from normal IDEs by the added support they offer for the mobile 
platforms.
Some cross-platform development frameworks are also available which helps in the development of 
mobile applications. These run on multiple platforms and do not specifically require coding.
4.2 Common Development Platform Tools
Software development kits usually provide various utilities which are helpful in developing and testing 
applications. These utilities span a wide range of purposes, such as taking screenshots, extracting 
logs, sending random events and notifications to the device, monitoring various parameters such as 
memory and CPU utilization, and creating virtual devices.
Some examples of such tools are Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager, Android Debug Bridge 
(ADB), and Android Device Monitor for Android and Instruments for iOS.

4.3 Emulators & Simulators
4.3.1 Overview of Emulators & Simulators
In the context of this syllabus, the terms emulator and simulator refer to mobile emulator or mobile 
simulator. The terms simulator and emulator are sometimes used interchangeably but incorrectly. For 
definitions please refer to the glossary in chapter 8.
A simulator models the runtime environment, whereas an emulator models the hardware and utilizes 
the same runtime environment as the physical hardware. Applications tested on a simulator are 
compiled into a dedicated version, which works in the simulator but not on a real device. Thus, it is 
independent of the real OS.
By contrast, applications compiled to be deployed and tested on an emulator are compiled into the 
actual byte-code that could be also used by the real device.
Simulators and emulators are very useful in the early stage of development as these typically integrate 
with development environments and allow quick deployment, testing, and monitoring of applications.
Simulators are sometimes also used as replacement for real devices in testing. However, this is even 
more limited than the usage of emulators, as the application tested on a simulator differs at byte-code 
level from the application that will be distributed.
Emulators are also used to reduce the cost of test environments by replacing real devices for some of 
the testing. An emulator cannot fully replace a device because the emulator may behave in a different 
manner than the mobile device it tries to mimic. In addition, some features may not be supported such 
as (multi)touch, accelerometer, and others. This is partly caused by limitations of the platform used to 
run the emulator.
4.3.2 Using Emulators and Simulators
Using emulators and simulators for mobile testing can be helpful for various reasons.
Each mobile operating system development environment typically comes with its own bundled 
emulator and simulator. Third party emulators and simulators are also available.
A tester may use whichever emulator or simulator suits their purpose. Using the emulator or simulator 
requires launching them, installing the necessary app on them and then testing the app as if it were on 
the actual device.
Usually emulators and simulators allow the setting of various usage parameters. These settings might 
include network emulation at different speeds, signal strengths and packet losses, changing the 
orientation, generating interrupts, and GPS location data. Some of these settings can be very useful
because they can be difficult or costly to replicate with real devices, such as global GPS positions or 
signal strengths.
Connecting to the emulators for the purpose of installation might require using command line tools 
such as for Android Debug Bridge (ADB) for Android or connecting from within the integrated 
development environment as with Xcode or Android Studio.

4.4 Setting up a Test Lab
The following approaches are used to set up a mobile test lab:
On-premise lab
With an on-premise lab all the devices, emulators and simulators are located on site. Device selection
can be done on the basis of various factors such as rank of the device (as found in Google or other 
analytics), operating system and versions, screen dimensions and density, availability and cost, 
special features, and importance in targeted audience.
On-premise lab advantages include the availability of devices for specific proximity-based testing and 
sensor specific aspects such as battery, touch, and enhanced security.
Setting up this type of lab may require large budgets depending on the devices to be procured and 
maintained. Additional challenges include timely availability and difficulties with testing in different 
locations and environments.
Remote test lab
These labs are important and helpful for testing when devices or networks are not physically available 
on site. Remote device access (RDA) allows access via a network connection to various devices 
hosted in the provider’s data center. Each potential RDA provider needs to be evaluated for 
compliance with the requirements, especially for security.
Some remote labs provide the following additional features:
● Dedicated physical device versions (e.g., Samsung mobile devices lab).
● Generic devices for a particular operating system and version only.
● Robotic arms for performing touch and gesture related operations.
● Virtual private network (VPN) connections to give access to the device.
● Cellular connections with various cellular network providers.
● Automation tools and services.
Some of the factors to be kept in mind when using remote test labs include slow device 
responsiveness and limited options for interacting with devices such as multi-touch and gestures. This 
can be cost-effective for sporadic use, but is generally more expensive if used for extended periods of 
time for a wide range of devices.
Other factors include on-demand platform availability compared to the need to obtain access to 
missing devices in the local lab and scalability of the lab, as it can grow and shrink as the project 
evolves.
Test scenarios that include sensors such as NFC/Bluetooth or battery consumption are often hard to 
test in the cloud. However, the different geographical locations of remote labs may help with tests that 
need network and GPS connections.
A test lab can utilize either one or a combination of the two approaches, depending on the type of 
tests that need to be performed.

Learning Objectives for Automating the Test Execution
5.1 Automation Approaches
MAT-5.1.1 (K2) Distinguish between common automation approaches and frameworks for mobile 
application testing.
5.2 Automation Methods
MAT-5.2.1 (K2) Describe various automation methods for testing mobile apps.
5.3 Automation Tools Evaluation
MAT-5.3.1 (K1) Recall the various parameters to be considered during the evaluation of mobile 
testing automation tools.
5.4 Approaches for setting up an Automation Test Lab
MAT-5.4.1 (K2) Distinguish between common approaches of creating test labs with advantages 
and disadvantages with respect to test automation.
5.1 Automation Approaches
Various automation approaches and frameworks exist that can be used in mobile application testing. 
The choice of approach will partly be determined by the type of application. 
Two common test automation approaches used are:
● User-agent based testing
● Device-based testing
User-agent based testing utilizes the user-agent identifier string sent by the browser to spoof a 
particular browser on a particular device. This approach can be used for executing mobile web 
applications. Device-based testing on the other hand involves running the application under test 
directly on the device. This approach can be used for all types of mobile applications. 
The application type can also determine the test automation framework that would be suitable for that 
application. Mobile web can be tested using the usual web application automation tools on the 
desktop, whilst native apps might need specific tools. Platform providers may also provide automation 
tools dedicated for the platform.
Automation approaches used for conventional applications are often applicable to mobile applications 
as well. These include capture/playback, data-driven, keyword-driven and behavior-driven testing as 
described in the ISTQB® Foundation Level syllabus [ISTQB_CTFL_2018] and in the ISTQB®
Advanced Level Specialist Test Automation Engineer syllabus [ISTQB_CTAL_TAE_2016].
Key capabilities that a mobile application testing framework should typically include are:
● Object identification
● Object operations
Certified Tester Specialist
Mobile Application Testing Foundation Level
Syllabus
Version 2019 Page 40 of 51
3 May 2019
© International Software Testing Qualifications Board
● Test reports
● Application programming interfaces and extendable capabilities
● Adequate documentation
● Integrations with other tools
● Independent of test development practice
5.2 Automation Methods
To develop automated tests, the tester needs to understand the automation script recording or 
creation mechanism, and how to access and interact with the application's graphical objects such as 
buttons, list boxes, and input fields.
Several methods exist for identifying a graphical object used for the mobile test automation. These 
include image recognition, OCR/text recognition, and object recognition (web or native, depending on 
the app type).
A Mobile Application Tester needs to not only practice the graphical object detection and identification, 
but also to understand which object identification method will be the most capable in enabling
successful tests to be run on a large variety of mobile devices, in parallel and continuously.
Key differences between the script creation methods are:
Item of Comparison Object Identification Image/OCR Comparison
Reliability As long as the identifier is constant 
the screen layout can be changed. 
The risk is that objects can be 
identified and interacted with in the 
code while being hidden from the 
user. This may lead to false negative 
test results. 
Images can be scaled according to 
screen size, but tests will fail as soon 
as the layout changes.
User experience Usually manual scripting is required, 
at least to improve recorded scripts 
for readability and maintainability.
Full GUI-based testing without the need 
for scripting.
Execution speed Tends to be faster than Image/OCR 
comparison, especially when using 
native tools provided by the system 
manufacturer. 
Tends to be slower due to the need to 
compare the screen pixel by pixel with 
a baseline image.
Maintenance Depends on the quality of the test 
scripts.
Mainly in providing changed baseline 
images.
Authoring challenge Knowledge required of the scripting 
language and of software design 
methods to build a sustainable 
automation solution.
Generation of baseline images, 
especially when app changes often.
5.3 Automation Tools Evaluation
To be successful in creating test automation solutions, the test automation teams need to choose an 
appropriate set of tools. Understanding the key differences of the available tools and their suitability for 
the project requirements needs to be considered (see also [ISTQB_CTAL_TAE_2016]).
The evaluation parameters for test automation tools can be broken into two categories:
● Organizational fit
● Technical fit
Certified Tester Specialist
Mobile Application Testing Foundation Level
Syllabus
Version 2019 Page 41 of 51
3 May 2019
© International Software Testing Qualifications Board
Organizational fit parameters are described in chapter 6.2 of the ISTQB® Foundation Level syllabus 
[ISTQB_CTFL_2018].
Technical fit parameters include the following:
● Test automation requirements and complexities such as the use of new features like FaceID, 
fingerprint and chatbots by the app.
● Test environment requirements, such as varying network conditions, import or creating test 
data, and server-side virtualization.
● Test reporting and feedback loop capabilities.
● The ability of the framework to manage and drive execution on a large scale either locally or in 
a test lab in the cloud.
● Integration of the test framework with other tools used in the organization.
● Support and documentation availability for current and future upgrades.
5.4 Approaches for setting up an Automation Test Lab
When performing mobile application testing, developers and testers have choices around the device 
test lab they would use to target their test automation against.
● On-premise device test lab
● Remote device test lab
Various combinations of these approaches can be applied. Their principal characteristics are
described and compared in section 4.4.
On-premise device test labs are generally difficult and time consuming to maintain. Having devices 
locally in parallel with emulators and simulators would best serve the early development and testing 
phases of the mobile app.
When reaching a more advanced stage of the app development, teams need to perform full regression 
test, functional tests, and non-functional tests. These tests are best executed on a full device lab. This 
is where a remote device test lab is managed, continuously updated, and maintained in the cloud.
Such remote device test labs complement an on-premise device test lab and ensure that sufficient 
combinations of device and operating system are available and up to date. By making use of 
commonly available remote device test labs, teams get access to a larger set of supported capabilities 
including richer test reports and advanced test automation capabilities.
Lastly, when executing at scale through a test automation framework or through a continuous 
integration job (CI), stability of the overall test lab is key for test efficiency and reliability. Such labs are 
typically designed to ensure that devices and operating systems are always available and stable.
Remote device test labs are not always necessary in the later development stages of the app. Well 
designed and maintained on-premise device test labs can be as good as or better than any remote 
device test lab.
